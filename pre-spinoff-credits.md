# List of Original Contributors

Lingua Franca started as a spinoff from Mycroft-core (not a fork.) Consequently, the source repository no longer lists those who contributed to this code before the spinoff. Below is an attempt to list them.

Some names may be missing. Some may be listed twice by mistake, especially if they've committed code under more than one name. Names are as they appeared in `git log`, or as they're familiar to the Mycroft community, and are in no particular order.

If you notice a name is missing (especially your own!) please notify the LF maintainers. This list was created by naively parsing Mycroft-core's `git log`, and we may have missed a spot.
